It seems like you've found this repository! Well, **congratulations ðŸ˜„** This is where we house all of code for Web Development related items, and sometimes you'll see crossover between other SIG's because I am a product focused person. Any sort of software development that brings value will need the expertise of other fields, such as AI, Data Vis, etc. Hence, I will be working closely with them to bring you workshops that will produce value for your future self.
